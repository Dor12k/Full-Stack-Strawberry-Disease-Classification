The dataset was split into 1,450 images for training, 307 for validation, and 743 for testing. Using <strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong>, we preprocessed and cleaned the images, resizing them to a standard format and applying data augmentation to improve model robustness.</li><li><strong>Model Building with Transfer Learning</strong>: We implemented transfer learning, a method where we fine-tuned pre-trained models on our dataset. The models we experimented with included <strong>VGG16</strong>, <strong>VGG19</strong>, and <strong>ResNet50</strong>. This stage involved training the models using <strong>Google Colab</strong>, utilizing the <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>Keras</strong> libraries in <strong>Python</strong>. After comparing the performance of each model based on accuracy and validation loss, we selected <strong>ResNet50</strong> as the final model due to its superior results.</li></ol>",

    "second_paragraph": "<ol><li><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong>: Training the models involved multiple iterations and evaluations. <strong>Matplotlib</strong> was used to visualize the training process, tracking metrics like loss and accuracy over time. ResNet50 outperformed the other models with the highest accuracy on the test set, making it the model of choice for the next stage.</li><li><strong>Web Application Development</strong>: To make the model accessible to users, we initially built a web application using <strong>Django</strong> with <strong>Python</strong> for the backend and <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for the frontend. Later, we upgraded the project by separating it into a backend and a frontend architecture. On the backend, we continued using Python and Django, transitioning to <strong>Django REST Framework (DRF)</strong> to build a more robust API with features such as JWT authentication, ViewSets, and serializers. For the frontend, we switched to a modern stack using <strong>Node.js </strong>and <strong>React</strong> with <strong>Vite</strong> and styled the interface with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. We also added comprehensive testing using <strong>Pytest</strong> for the backend and Jest for the frontend and integrated a CI pipeline using<strong> GitHub Actions</strong>. The web application allows users to upload images of strawberry leaves, which are processed and classified by the trained ResNet50 model. The system uses a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database to manage user data and classification results.</li><li><strong>Android App Implementation</strong>: We further developed an Android application, providing a mobile solution where users can classify diseases either by selecting an image from their gallery or by capturing a photo using the device’s camera. For this, we converted the ResNet50 model into a <strong>TensorFlow Lite</strong> format to run efficiently on mobile devices. The Android app was built in <strong>Android Studio</strong> using <strong>Java</strong> for native mobile development.</li><li><strong>Deployment on AWS</strong>:&nbsp;Finally, the web application was deployed on AWS using services like <strong>EC2</strong> for server hosting, <strong>RDS</strong> for the <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database, and <strong>S3</strong> for static file storage. The infrastructure was containerized using <strong>Docker</strong>, and <strong>Nginx</strong> was employed as a reverse proxy to manage traffic and improve scalability. Additionally, we used <strong>Amazon SageMaker</strong> to host the <strong>TensorFlow</strong> model, providing a dedicated endpoint that receives images of strawberry leaves and returns disease classification predictions.</li></ol>",

    "first_paragraph": "<p>Strawberries are among the most popular and beloved fruits worldwide, cherished for their sweet taste, vibrant red color, and delightful fragrance. They are not only delicious treats but also packed with numerous health benefits. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about strawberries—from their history, cultivation, and nutritional value to tips on how to grow and enjoy them.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>1. History of Strawberries</strong></p><p>The modern strawberry, known scientifically as <strong>Fragaria × ananas</strong>, is a hybrid species of two wild strawberry varieties: the North American <strong>Fragaria virginiana</strong> and the Chilean <strong>Fragaria chiloensis</strong>. It was first cultivated in Europe in the 18th century.</p><p>However, wild strawberries have been consumed for thousands of years. Ancient Romans believed in the medicinal properties of strawberries, using them to treat a variety of ailments. Native Americans also cultivated and enjoyed strawberries long before Europeans arrived.</p><p>The name \"strawberry\" is thought to have originated from the practice of mulching the plant with straw to protect its berries, though some suggest it refers to the way the plant spreads its runners across the ground like straw.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>2. Types of Strawberries</strong></p><p>Strawberries come in several varieties, which can be broadly divided into three categories based on their growing and fruiting patterns:</p><ul><li><strong>June-bearing Strawberries</strong>: These strawberries produce a single, large harvest in late spring or early summer, typically lasting for 2 to 3 weeks.</li><li><strong>Ever-bearing Strawberries</strong>: These plants yield two or three smaller crops throughout the growing season, typically in early summer, late summer, and fall.</li><li><strong>Day-neutral Strawberries</strong>: These produce fruit continuously throughout the growing season, as long as the temperatures remain between 35°F (1.6°C) and 85°F (29.4°C). Day-neutral varieties are particularly popular in regions with mild climates.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>3. Nutritional Value and Health Benefits</strong></p><p>Strawberries are a <strong>nutritional powerhouse</strong>, low in calories but rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Here's a breakdown of their nutritional value:</p><ul><li><strong>Rich in Vitamin C</strong>: Strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C, which supports immune function, skin health, and the absorption of iron.</li><li><strong>High in Antioxidants</strong>: Strawberries contain powerful antioxidants like <strong>anthocyanins</strong> and <strong>ellagic acid</strong>, which help neutralize free radicals in the body, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases.</li><li><strong>Dietary Fiber</strong>: Strawberries provide a good amount of fiber, which supports digestive health and helps regulate blood sugar levels.</li><li><strong>Low in Calories</strong>: One cup (about 150 grams) of strawberries contains just 50 calories, making them a perfect snack for those watching their calorie intake.</li><li><strong>Folate (Vitamin B9)</strong>: Folate is important for cell function and tissue growth, particularly during pregnancy.</li><li><strong>Heart Health</strong>: Consuming strawberries has been associated with improved heart health due to their ability to lower cholesterol levels and reduce blood pressure.</li><li><strong>Anti-Inflammatory Properties</strong>: The high content of antioxidants and polyphenols in strawberries can reduce inflammation and support overall well-being.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "second_paragraph": "<p><strong>4. How to Grow Strawberries</strong></p><p>Growing strawberries can be a rewarding experience, as they are relatively easy to cultivate at home with proper care. Here's what you need to know to grow them successfully:</p><ul><li><strong>Climate and Soil</strong>: Strawberries thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. They require plenty of sunlight, ideally 6 to 8 hours per day, and grow best in temperate climates.</li><li><strong>Planting</strong>: Strawberries can be grown from seeds, but it is much easier to plant bare-root strawberry crowns or potted strawberry plants. Plant them in early spring or late fall, spacing each plant about 12-18 inches apart.</li><li><strong>Watering</strong>: Strawberries need regular watering, especially during the growing season. Water them at the base to prevent fungal diseases, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged.</li><li><strong>Mulching</strong>: Mulching with straw or organic matter helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and protect the fruit from direct contact with the soil.</li><li><strong>Fertilization</strong>: Use a balanced fertilizer throughout the growing season, but avoid over-fertilizing, as it may lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of fruit production.</li><li><strong>Pruning and Maintenance</strong>: Remove runners if you're focusing on fruit production rather than plant expansion. Also, trim any damaged or diseased leaves to maintain plant health.</li><li><strong>Harvesting</strong>: Strawberries are ready to harvest when they are fully red and firm.

    "introduction": "Growing strawberries in your home garden is a rewarding experience, offering fresh, delicious berries. These perennial plants thrive in various climates and can be cultivated in garden beds, containers, or hanging baskets. With proper care, they produce fruit for several years.",
    "first_paragraph": "<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p><p>Strawberries are perennial plants known for their vibrant fruits and attractive foliage. They thrive in various climates and can be grown in garden beds, containers, or hanging baskets. With proper care, strawberries can produce fruit for several years.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>2. Selecting Strawberry Varieties</strong></p><p>Choosing the right strawberry variety is crucial for success. Strawberries are generally categorized into three main types:</p><p><strong>a. June-Bearing</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Produce a large, concentrated harvest in late spring or early summer (June).</li><li><strong>Best For:</strong> Gardeners who prefer a big harvest once a year.</li><li><strong>Examples:</strong> 'Earliglow,' 'Honeoye.'</li></ul><p><strong>b. Ever-Bearing</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Yield two to three harvests per growing season—typically in spring, summer, and fall.</li><li><strong>Best For:</strong> Continuous fruit production throughout the season.</li><li><strong>Examples:</strong> 'Ozark Beauty,' 'Seascape.'</li></ul><p><strong>c. Day-Neutral</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Produce fruit continuously from late spring until the first frost, regardless of day length.</li><li><strong>Best For:</strong> Extended harvest periods and regions with mild climates.</li><li><strong>Examples:</strong> 'Tribute,' 'Albion.'</li></ul><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Consider your climate, desired harvest times, and disease resistance when selecting varieties. Combining different types can extend your harvesting season.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>3. Site Selection and Preparation</strong></p><p><strong>a. Choosing the Right Location</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Select a spot that receives at least <strong>6-8 hours of direct sunlight</strong> daily. More sunlight typically results in better fruit production.</li><li><strong>Soil:</strong> Strawberries prefer <strong>well-draining, fertile soil</strong> with a pH between <strong>5.5 and 6.8</strong>.</li><li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good airflow helps prevent fungal diseases.</li></ul><p><strong>b. Preparing the Soil</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Clear the Area:</strong> Remove weeds, rocks, and debris from the chosen site.</li><li><strong>Soil Amendment:</strong> Incorporate <strong>organic matter</strong> like compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and structure.</li><li><strong>Testing Soil pH:</strong> Use a soil test kit to ensure optimal pH levels. Amend if necessary using lime to raise pH or sulfur to lower it.</li><li><strong>Bed Preparation:</strong> Create raised beds if drainage is an issue. This prevents root rot and other moisture-related problems.</li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><br></p>",

    "introduction": "Discover how strawberries transformed from wild herbs into a beloved global fruit. Learn about their ancient origins, medieval symbolism, and the breeding revolution that shaped today’s strawberries.",
    "first_paragraph": "<p><strong>Early Origins: The Wild Strawberry</strong></p><p><strong>The first strawberries weren’t cultivated by humans but grew wild across different parts of the world. Historical evidence suggests that strawberries have been growing wild for over 2,000 years. The Fragaria</strong>, or wild strawberry, is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia.</p><ol><li><strong>Ancient Rome:</strong> The earliest written records of strawberries date back to ancient Rome. Roman writers like Virgil and Ovid mention wild strawberries in their works, primarily for their beauty and medicinal properties. The fruit was used to treat digestive issues, skin irritations, and even melancholy.</li><li><strong>Native American Use:</strong> In North America, Native American tribes valued wild strawberries for both food and medicine. They would eat the berries fresh, use them in breads, and mix them into various dishes. Strawberries were also integral to cultural ceremonies and were symbolically linked to spring and renewal.</li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>Medieval Europe and the Symbolism of the Strawberry</strong></p><p><strong>During the Middle Ages, strawberries held symbolic significance in European society. The fruit was seen as a representation of purity and righteousness, often associated with the Virgin Mary and depicted in religious artwork. Knights and nobility would decorate banquet tables with strawberry plants to showcase their virtues and hospitality.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Medicinal Uses:</strong> Beyond their symbolic role, strawberries were believed to have medicinal properties during medieval times. They were used as a treatment for fever, throat infections, and kidney stones, although the effectiveness of these remedies was more folklore than science.</li><li><strong>Gardens of the Nobility:</strong> By the 13th century, strawberries began to appear in European gardens, especially in France, where nobles would cultivate them as ornamental plants. However, these early efforts focused more on aesthetics than food production, as the wild strawberry varieties were small and not commercially viable.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p>",
    "first_media": "images/article/article/history-of-the-strawberry-a-journey-through-time/history.jpg",
    "second_paragraph": "<p><strong>The Emergence of Cultivated Strawberries in the 16th and 17th Centuries</strong></p><p>The development of the strawberry as a cultivated crop took a significant leap during the 16th century. Larger, more productive strawberry varieties were sought after as demand grew, leading to more organized efforts to grow strawberries for consumption.</p><ol><li><strong>France’s Role in Cultivation:</strong> The French began experimenting with wild strawberry species in the early 1600s. <strong>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</strong>, a prominent French horticulturist, was instrumental in introducing and cultivating strawberries on a larger scale. At this point, strawberries became more popular as an edible fruit, enjoyed in jams, tarts, and fresh at royal feasts.</li><li><strong>Introduction of the American Strawberry (Fragaria virginiana):</strong> In the 17th century, European settlers returning from North America brought with them the <strong>Fragaria virginiana</strong>, a strawberry species native to the eastern United States. This variety produced more fruit than its European counterparts and was eagerly cultivated in Europe.</li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>A Revolution in Breeding: The Birth of the Modern Strawberry</strong></p><p>The strawberry as we know it today, large and juicy, didn’t exist until the 18th century. The turning point came when European horticulturists accidentally crossbred two strawberry species—<strong>Fragaria virginiana</strong> from North America and <strong>Fragaria chiloensis</strong>, a larger strawberry from Chile brought to France in the early 1700s.</p><ul><li><strong>The French Discovery:</strong> In 1714, a French engineer named <strong>Amédée-François Frézier</strong> brought <strong>Fragaria chiloensis</strong> back to Europe from Chile. When this Chilean strawberry was crossed with the North American strawberry, it produced a hybrid with larger, sweeter fruit and greater hardiness. This hybrid, known as <strong>Fragaria × ananassa</strong>, became the foundation of modern strawberry cultivation.</li><li><strong>Spread Across Europe:</strong> This new variety quickly gained popularity across Europe, especially in Britain. By the late 18th century, strawberries were grown commercially in England, and soon, strawberry breeding programs were established to further refine the size, sweetness, and hardiness of the plant.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p>",

    "third_paragraph": "<p><strong>Strawberries in the Modern Era</strong></p><p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, strawberry production spread rapidly, particularly in North America, where industrial agriculture allowed for large-scale production.</p><ol><li><strong>The Strawberry Boom in the U.S.:</strong> By the mid-1800s, strawberries were being grown extensively in the United States, with advances in transportation (particularly railways) allowing fresh strawberries to be transported to distant markets. This made strawberries more accessible to the public, not just as a luxury for the wealthy.</li><li><strong>California’s Dominance:</strong> Today, <strong>California</strong> dominates global strawberry production, producing about 90% of the strawberries grown in the United States. The state’s mild climate and innovative farming techniques have helped make strawberries a year-round fruit in many parts of the world.</li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>The Cultural Impact of Strawberries</strong></p><p>Beyond their agricultural history, strawberries have become embedded in cultural traditions and cuisine worldwide.</p><ul><li><strong>Strawberries and Cream:</strong> One of the most iconic culinary uses of strawberries is the classic dish of <strong>strawberries and cream</strong>, famously associated with <strong>Wimbledon</strong> tennis tournaments since the late 19th century. This tradition has made strawberries synonymous with British summer events.</li><li><strong>Strawberry Festivals:</strong> Around the world, many towns and regions celebrate strawberry harvests with festivals, where strawberry-based foods, beverages, and activities are central to the celebration. Notable strawberry festivals take place in <strong>Plant City, Florida</strong>, and <strong>Poteet, Texas</strong>.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>From ancient wild varieties to the modern hybrid cultivars, the history of the strawberry is a tale of discovery, cultivation, and enjoyment. What was once a small, wild berry has evolved into a globally adored fruit, cherished for its taste, versatility, and nutritional benefits. Whether in gardens, markets, or cultural traditions, the strawberry’s journey reflects the intertwined nature of agriculture, innovation, and human appreciation for nature’s bounty.</p>",
